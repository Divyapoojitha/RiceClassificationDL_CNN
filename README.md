Abstract:
Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. 
These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. 
With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. 
In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. 
A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. 
Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate can be calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model can be given in tables.
